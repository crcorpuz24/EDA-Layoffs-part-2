In my recent Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project, I delved into a comprehensive dataset to uncover insights and inform future data-driven decisions. Hereâ€™s what the project entailed:

Data Acquisition: Gathered and imported data from various sources to create a rich and diverse dataset.

Data Cleaning: Ensured data quality by addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

Descriptive Statistics: Calculated and interpreted summary statistics to understand data distribution and central tendencies.
